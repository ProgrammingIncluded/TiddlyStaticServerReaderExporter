This plugin reduces the need to know the underlying structure of TiddlyWiki by supporting the following:
- A control panel that can export a standalone tiddly wiki that can GET from a host's static folder.
- Removes the adapter abstraction like `tiddlyweb` so that TiddlyWiki `download` and `save` functionalities are not affected.
  - Provides an export button to get the generated html file.
